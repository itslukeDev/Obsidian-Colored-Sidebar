## A Colored Sidebar CSS Snippet for Obsidian

### _Create a [colorfully cascading](https://youtu.be/rAkerV8rlow) Obsidian sidebar!_

![Example](./example.png)

This snippet targets folders beginning with numbered prefixes and applies full color formatting based on the root colors listed inside the snippet. The prefixes are both customizable and extensible; feel free to change, add, and remove them based on your own titles and vault structure!

By default, the snippet includes 8+1 colors, with additional common colors provided as a starting point for your own customization. Simply swap out the color variable names in the prefix variables to customize your sidebar's appearance.

## Installation

1. Open Obsidian and navigate to `Settings -> Appearance`
2. Scroll down to the "CSS Snippets" section
3. Click the "Open Snippets Folder" button
4. Place the `Colored Sidebar Items.css` file from this repository into the opened folder
5. Back in Obsidian, click the "Reload Snippets" button
6. Toggle on the "Colored Sidebar Items" snippet

See the [How It Works](#how-it-works) section below to complete the setup in your vault.

## How It Works

The snippet targets folders beginning with numbered prefixes (00 through 07, plus 99). These prefixes have assigned color values inside the CSS file and form a continuous gradient when lined up together (with the exception of 99).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to prepend your folder names with these prefixes for the colors to work!

### Customizing Colors

1. Open the CSS snippet in your preferred text editor
2. Locate the `root` section
3. Find the color variables with their hexadecimal code values
4. To modify a color, replace the hex value with your new color value
5. To add a new color, follow the existing pattern and add a new variable in this section

### Customizing Prefixes

1. Looking under the `.theme-light` and `.theme-dark` properties you can the prefix variables. There you can specify what color should be used for what prefix for both themes
2. Further down in the CSS file, youâ€™ll see the CSS class names targeting folders, named something like `.nav-folder-title[data-path^="00"]`.
   - Each colored group has four classes targeting the same prefix.
   - To change prefixes:
     - Replace the numbers in quotations with any other number, letter, or word.
     - For advanced selector modifications, see [this CSS selectors guide](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/attribute/)

### Adding Additional Folders

1. Copy one of the groups of CSS classes that target the same prefix
2. Change the duplicated prefix and replace any instance of a prefix variable (e.g., `--prefix-01`) with your desired color variable

> [!NOTE]
> Several built-in color variables are included but not used by default. These are from a matching palette that you're welcome to use for expanding your colored sidebar!
